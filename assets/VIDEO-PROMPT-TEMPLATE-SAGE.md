# Example: Grammar/Usage Question

## Question
```
The quantum physicist Dr. Elena Vasquez has dedicated her career to
unraveling the mysteries of particle behavior. Her groundbreaking
research on quantum entanglement _______ implications for secure
communications and computing.

A) have far-reaching
B) has far-reaching
C) having far-reaching
D) are having far-reaching
```

## Correct Answer: B) has far-reaching

## Script

[SCRIPT START]

**[SCENE 1 - 8 sec | Sage: Base standing pose | Text: Question displayed]**

Let's work through this grammar question together. We need to find the right verb form to complete the sentence about Dr. Vasquez's research.

**[SCENE 2 - 8 sec | Sage: Thinking pose | Text: Subject highlighted - "Her groundbreaking research"]**

First, let's identify the subject. What noun is actually doing the action here? It's "her groundbreaking research" - not Dr. Vasquez, not quantum entanglement.

**[SCENE 3 - 8 sec | Sage: Pointing pose | Text: "research" circled, labeled "singular"]**

Here's the key insight: "research" is a singular noun. Even though it sounds like it could be plural - all that research! - grammatically it's singular. Like "information" or "news."

**[SCENE 4 - 8 sec | Sage: Thinking pose | Text: Answer choices displayed]**

So we need a singular verb. That eliminates A and D right away - "have" and "are having" are plural forms.

**[SCENE 5 - 8 sec | Sage: Pointing pose | Text: B and C remaining, C crossed out]**

Between B and C: "having far-reaching" isn't a complete verb - it's a participle. We need a proper finite verb to make this a complete sentence.

**[SCENE 6 - 7 sec | Sage: Excited pose | Text: Answer B highlighted]**

The answer is B - "has far-reaching." Singular subject, singular verb, complete sentence. Perfect!
